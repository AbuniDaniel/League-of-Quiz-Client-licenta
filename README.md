## Short description

The project is based on guessing characters from the game [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends)

Our questions are based on guessing the champion in the picture, having some pieces from the whole picture. You can use hints to randomly reveal a hidden part.

These questions are divided into 2 types of difficulty: easy and hard. On the easy difficulty you will receive a default skin for guessing, and on the hard difficulty you will receive a skin (different from the default one) for guessing and this makes the difficulty increase.

Furthermore, these 2 difficulties are divided as follows: for both difficulties, the image will be divided into 4 and 8 pieces, these being placed on a matrix of 2x2 and 4x4 respectively.

## Example of Easy difficulty divided into 4 pieces
